Yona puts a strong focus on code readability. Yona abstract users from dealing with non-blocking asynchronous computations and parallelism. While these features are commonly available in other languages nowadays, they are almost exclusively non-native solutions that come in forms of libraries or frameworks and are difficult to integrate with existing codebases. On top of that, dealing with these additional libraries requires a conscious effort of the programmer to choose/learn/integrate these libraries into their mindset when writing new code.

This section would nevertheless focus on why particular features are present in Yona while others are not. For readers more familiar with other paradigms, such as object oriented or imperative programming, this section should be about eliminating some concerns users of these languages might have. Yona does not support imperative programming , as that requires explicit control flow and state manipulation. An example for that is a loop with a counter, that gets increased at each step. Yona does not have variables that could be modified, nor does it have \"loops\" in the imperative sense. Instead recursion or generators may be used for iteration. When it comes to object oriented features, it's important to separate two things. One is that most common feature of object oriented languages, encapsulation, in the traditional sense is about hiding mutable state. As previously stated, Yona doesn't have mutable state, so hiding it in an object doesn't provide much of a value. Yona is a lexically scoped language though and fully supports hiding internal implementation details either via scoping expressions ( let , do or case ), or using closures as well (lambdas). This means that a particular alias or a name is only available within the scope in which it is defined. Moreover, modules allow user to expose only certain functions, and not others. This is a form of interface concept, as it is known in the object oriented world. Polymorophism can take various shapes in Yona. First obvious option that comes to mind, is using pattern matching. A function can be defined for different patterns and in that way replicate polymorphic methods from object oriented languages. Another possibility could be having multiple modules defined, with the same interface (exposed functions) and switch them dynamically based on any arbitrary conditions the user needs. There is a lot of flexibility in Yona due to its dynamic nature. When it comes to statically typed functional languages, such as Haskell or Elm, one might wonder about things like purity, type classes or Algebraic Data Types (ADTs). Yona is not a pure language, in the sense that it does not enforce separation of side effects and pure computations (side-effect free). Side effects represent operations modifying an external state, for example some kind of a global state, input/output, etc. Type classes have no real counterpart in Yona since Yona is dynamically typed. What would otherwise be achieved using type classes, would have to be achieved by a convention of sorts in Yona, for example that there would be an expectation of certain modules to export certain interface. ADTs in Yona do not need to be defined upfront, as there is no compilation phase to check their validity or perform exhaustivness checks (where a compiler ensures that all possible cases are being tested in a case expression). That doesn't mean that ADTs cannot be modeled in Yona, they can, they just won't have a static type check performed on them before running the program. They may be represented using symbols , tuples or records , or any combination of those. Execution Model \u00b6 Yona provides fully transparent runtime system that integrates asynchronous non-blocking IO features with concurrent execution of the code. This means, there is no special syntax or special data types representing asynchronous computations. Everything related to non-blocking IO is hidden within the runtime and exposed via the standard library, and all expressions consisting of asynchronous expressions(an asynchronous expression is usually obtained from the standard library or created by function async ) are evaluated in asynchronous, non-blocking matter. This approach provides several benefits to languages as opposed to having these features provided via external libaries, mainly that such library would have to be adopted by other libraries/frameworks in order to be usable and it would still impose additional boilerplate simply because libraries cannot typically change language syntax/semantics. This is why Yona provides these features from day one, built into language syntax and semantics and therefore it is always available to any program without any external dependencies. At the same time, putting these features directly on the language/runtime level allows for additional optimizations that could otherwise be tricky or impossible. Example \u00b6 Following example will be used as a case study into Yona's execution model. Note that this example code actually will not work from Yona 0.8.1 , because of the resource management feature, but it is still a good example for understanding the underlying evaluation model. Make sure to read the next section after this one to see how this program needs to be written in more recent Yona versions. The same properties of the evaluation still apply! let keys_file = File :: open \"tests/Keys.txt\" { : read } values_file = File :: open \"tests/Values.txt\" { : read } keys = File :: read_lines keys_file values = File :: read_lines values_file () = File :: close keys_file () = File :: close values_file in Seq :: zip keys values |> Dict :: from_seq In this example, both files are read concurrently, without having to write any additional boiler-plate. How does Yona do this? A couple of things: first, check the difference between the do and let expressions on the syntax page. They both are used to evaluate multiple steps of computation, however do ensures that the steps take place in the same sequence as they are defined, let tries to parallelize non-blocking tasks. Yona will first perform a static analysis of the let expression in order to determine dependencies between aliases/steps . It knows that keys_file and values_file are used in the File::read_lines function and also knows that keys and values do not depend on each other , and so they may be ran concurrently . Yona doesn't parallelize keys_file and values_file , nor does it parallelize closing files - even though it seemingly should - there are no dependencies between these lines either. The trick is that File::read_lines is a function that returns a runtime level Promise (hidden from the user), and that means that reading two files in parallel is actually fine, since otherwise Yona would need to block the execution there, so it can just block on both being read at once. Another important concept here is that the order of aliases defined in the let expression does matter . Yona doesn't just randomly re-arrange them based on dependencies alone. If it did, it could for example close those files before they are ever read. That would be incorrect. Yona just uses static analysis of this expression to determine which aliases can be \"batched\" and actually batches the execution if they provide underlying Promises. Then the whole expression is transformed into something like this: Execute batch 1 (sequentially, since File::open does not return a Promise): keys_file = File :: open \"tests/Keys.txt\" { : read } values_file = File :: open \"tests/Values.txt\" { : read } Execute batch 2 (in parallel, since File::read_lines does return a Promise): keys = File :: read_lines keys_file values = File :: read_lines values_file Result from batch 2 is a Promise aggregating both keys and values, which when complete, executes batch 3: () = File :: close keys_file () = File :: close values_file Finally, the whole let expression is now a Promise, so run the final expression whenever it is ready: Seq :: zip keys values |> Dict :: from_seq |> IO :: println Yona automatically chains runtime Promises as needed and, more than that, it \"unwraps\" them whenever they are complete, so the runtime doesn't actually get bloated with propagating Promises all over the place. As soon as a Promise is computed, it becomes just a regular value again. These concepts allows programmers to focus on expressing concurrent programs much more easily and not having to deal with the details of the actual execution order. Additionally, when code must be executed sequentially, without explicit dependencies, a special expression do is available. Simplifying the example by using resource managemenet \u00b6 This example that concurrenly reads two files, line by line, and produces pairs of them as a dictionary can be implemented in Yona using its resource management features, as of Yona 0.8.1. Shorter version, equivalent in terms of features, but actually properly handling errors would look like: let keys = with File :: open \"tests/Keys.txt\" { : read } as keys_file File :: read_lines keys_file end values = with File :: open \"tests/Values.txt\" { : read } as values_file File :: read_lines values_file end in Seq :: zip keys values |> Dict :: from_seq Note that if error arises in the original example, files would not be closed. In this improved example they would. Otherwise, everything else regarding the non-blocking and parallel nature of this code stands. Implementation \u00b6 In terms of implementation, the runtime system of Yona can be viewed in terms of promise pipelineing or call-streams. The difference is that this pipelining and promise abstraction as such is completely transparent to the programmer and exists solely on the runtime level. Evaluation \u00b6 Evaluation of an Yona program consists of evaluating a single expression. This is important, because everything, including module definitions are simple expressions in Yona. Module loader then takes advantage of this principle, knowing that an imported module will be a file defining a module expression. It can simply evaluate it and retrieve the module itself.","title":"About Yona"},{"location":"about.html#philosophy","text":"For those familiar with other functional programming languages, such as Lisp, Haskell or Erlang, most of the concepts mentioned in this documentation are not totally alien.

In fact, any Yona program consists of exactly one expression. The syntax is intentionally very minimalistic and inspired by languages such as SML or Haskell. There are only a handful of keywords, however it is not as flexible in naming as Haskell for example. Yona programs have the ambition to be easily readable. Custom operators with names consisting of symbols alone are not that useful when reading a program for the first time. This is why Yona does not support custom operators named by symbols only. Supported operators are listed here . Yona does not have indentation specific parsing rules, but it does require new line at certain locations, which are noted in each individual expression descriptions. Comments are denoted by the # character and everything that follows this character until the end of line ( \\n or \\r\\n ) is considered a comment and ignored. The source code of a Yona program must be a valid UTF-8 text file. Terminology \u00b6 These are some common terms and phrases used throughout these texts explained to a user unfamiliar with functional concepts: Function application : simply function call. Currying : a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c) . Currying doesn\u2019t call a function. It just transforms it. The example uses JavaScript syntax for clarity. Alias : what would be a variable in other languages, but cannot have its value modified during program execution. Once set, this alias , or a name , always contains the same original value. Pattern : an expected shape of a value. If the value \"matches\" this pattern, then this value can also be deconstructed onto it. For instance a pattern can be a first element of a list and the rest. The first element can be also assigned to an alias (or the rest), provided that the value matched this pattern. Patterns can be nested and serve as a building blocks for describing data structure for matching and extracting values. Patterns may be as simple as an alias - that is also a pattern in a way. An alias will be matched if an only it is a new name, that was not previously assigned, or if it was, then only if the value is the same as the one previously assigned to it. Guard : guards are additional conditions that may be applied to patterns, that otherwise couldn't be expressed using pattern syntax. Typical example might be a function call to determine a type of a value for example. String interpolation : process of substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string. For instance, if there a template for saying hello to a person like \"Hello {parson}, nice to meet you!\", where the placeholder should be replaced with an actual person's name. This process is called string interpolation. Functions : definition and application \u00b6 Functions in Yona are defined in a very short and concise form. They may take arguments, which the function can pattern match on, and one function can be defined using multiple arguments. Function names must start with a lowercase letter, followed by any letters, numbers or underscores. A simple function to calculate a factorial can be written for example this way: factorial 1 = 1 factorial n = n * factorial ( n - 1 ) Each function case must be on a new line. More complex conditions in patterns can be specified in this way: factorial 1 = 1 factorial n | n > 1 = n * factorial ( n - 1 ) Which means that there is an additional condition for the n value to be greater than 0. There may be multiple guards for each pattern and they must each be on a new line. A guard starts with the | character, followed an expression that must evaluate to a boolean and finally an = and the expression to evaluate if the pattern matches and the guard is true . Guards are used to express conditions that must be met in order for the pattern to match. A pattern may have none, one or multiple guards, and the first one matching will cause the pattern to match. Note that function arguments may actually be full patterns, not just argument names. Patterns are described in the section named Pattern Matching . Yona additionally supports non-linear patterns, meaning that if a pattern contains the same name multiple times, than this name is required to match the same value so that the pattern would match. This can be handy when checking for one value to be present in multiple places/arguments without having to explicitly write a guard that would ensure the equality. Anonymous functions : aka lambdas \u00b6 Since functions are first-class citizens in Yona, it is necessary to provide means of passing functions as arguments, and also to define them without giving them a name. The following syntax is used in this case: \\a rgument_one argument_two -> argument_one argument_two # lambda function for summing its arguments A lambda function with no arguments is simply: \\-> :something . Function application : calling functions \u00b6 Calling a function simply means writing the name of the function and then specifying its arguments. If fewer arguments are provided than the function expects, this is considered a curried call, and the result of such function is a partially applied function, that can be called with the remaining arguments at a later point. So for example calling a factorial would look simply like this: factorial 5 Since Yona is a strictly evaluated language, meaning that arguments are evaluated before calling the function (as opposed to a lazy language, where arguments are only evaluated when actually used by the called function), there is one situation to be careful about and that is passing lambda functions of zero arguments as arguments to functions. This would be evaluated before actually calling the function. If there are no side-effects happening in the lambda, it might be perfectly fine, however if the lambda must be passed as a lambda, it needs to be wrapped into another lambda at the call-site, such as for example: let lambda = \\- > IO::println :hello in do_something_with \\- > lambda # instead of do_something_with lambda Then the do_something_with function will obtain its argument as a function and not a result of IO::println :hello function (that would be :hello btw). Pipes and operator precedence \u00b6 Since Yona is an ML-style language and, unlike many C-like languages, it does not use parentheses to denote a function application, it can become unclear which expressions are arguments of which function. Take for the following example: Seq :: take 5 Seq :: random 10 Is this a function call to the Seq::take function (that is a function take in the module Seq as explained later) with 3 arguments (5, Seq::random and 10) or is it Seq::random 10 supposed to be computed first and then its result used as a second argument to Seq::take ? If the latter, then it can be written this way: Seq :: take 5 ( Seq :: random 10 ) Since any expression can be put into parentheses and be given precedence in evaluation. Another way to write this would be using pipes : Seq :: take 5 <| Seq :: random 10 or Seq :: random 10 |> Seq :: take 5 These are all equivalent expression and it is up to the programmer's preference to decide which one to use. One nice feature that pipes have is that they can be used on multiple lines, such as: Seq :: random 10 |> Seq :: take 5 |> IO :: println let expression : defining local aliases / pattern matching in the scope of evaluated expression \u00b6 The let expression allows defining aliases in the scope of the executed expressions. Alias represents a name for some value, like a variable, unlike a variable though, its value may not be changed over time. This expression allows evaluating patterns as well, so it is possible to deconstruct a value from a sequence, tuple, set, dictionary or a record directly, for example: let ( 1 , second ) = ( 1 , 2 ) pattern = expression1 in expression2 As shown in this example, the let expression consists of two parts. Each line consists of an alias or a pattern on the left side, and the expression to evaluate on the right side. The result of this expression is then matched to the pattern on the left side, or simply assigned to an alias, depending on what is on the left side. The result of this let expression is the result of the expression2 expression. If a pattern on the left is not matched on any of the lines, the whole let expression raises a :nomatch exception. One line can use names defined in previous lines. Every alias/pattern must be defined on a new line. Note that the order of execution of the alias/pattern lines is not strictly sequential. Considering the example in the documentation homepage , some aliases can be executed as a single batch, in parallel, provided that two conditions are met: * the do not depend on each other (do not use names provided by other aliases in the same batch) * they return a runtime Promise (IO operations, or results of the async function) When both conditions are met, Yona can safely execute them concurrently, avoiding unnecessary blocking and effectively speeding up the program execution. do expression : sequencing side effects \u00b6 The do expression is used to define a sequence of side effecting expressions. This expression is very similar to the let expression in the sense that it allows defining aliases and patterns, however, it doesn't have a separate expression that would be used as a result of this expression. Instead the result of the last line is used as the result. do start_time = Time :: now ( : ok , line ) = File :: read_line f end_time = Time :: now printf line printf ( end_time - start_time ) end Note that unlike the case with the let expression, the order of executed expressions is guaranteed to be exactly the same as the order in which they are written. This is the main use-case of the do expression: to allow strict ordering of execution. It does not matter whether an expression returns a run-time level Promise (such as one that can be created by a IO call or by using the async function), the order defined in this expression is always guaranteed to be maintained. case expression : pattern matching \u00b6 case expression is used for pattern matching on an expression. Each line of this expression contains a pattern followed by an arrow -> and an expression that is evaluated in case of a successful pattern match. Patterns are tried in the order in which they are specified. The default case can be denoted by an underscore _ pattern that always evaluates as true. case File :: read_line f of ( : ok , line ) -> line ( : ok , : eof ) -> : eof err @ ( : error , _ ) -> err tuple # guard expressions below | tuple_size tuple == 3 -> : ok | true -> : ok _ -> ( : error , : unknown ) end Same as with function definition patterns, patterns in the case expression can contain guard expressions, as is the case in the tuple pattern in the example above. Patterns with a guard expression will be matched only the guard evaluated to true . Note that each pattern may have multiple guard expression, in which case the first one evaluated to true will match. Guards are tried in the order they are specified in. if expression : conditions \u00b6 if is a conditional expression that takes form: if expression then expression else expression Both the then and the else parts must be defined. The expression after if must evaluate to a boolean value. Empty sequences, dictionaries or similar will not work! New lines are allowed, but not required. with expression : resource management \u00b6 with expression handles resource management within its scope. It initilizes the scope with a context manager that is available within the scope its body. The syntax looks like this ( as alias part is optional): with contextManager as alias bodyExpression end The contextManager expression must return a context manager . If no alias is used, then the context manager is not meant to be interacted with directly. An example for this would be an STM transaction, that just needs to be present but there is no need to directly refer to it. Alternatively, if the alias is specified, as usually case with files, then the file created in the contextManager part of this expression can be directly accessed in bodyExpression . Example that reads all lines using File::read_lines function: with File :: open \"File.txt\" { : read } as file File :: read_lines file end with daemon expression : dropping result of a context manager expression \u00b6 with daemon is a special form of the with expression which behaves exactly the same way in relation to the resource management, but the difference is that unlike the standard with expression, it does not return the result of its body as the result, it returns a () instead. This way, whatever the body is doing, the with daemon expression does not need to wait for its completion, but it returns immediately. This is particularly useful when accepting socket connections. As soon as the socket connection is accepted, this expression will return () and the execution of its body is moved to the background. This is how one can easily implement concurrent servers in Yona. Example using Socket::accept function: let addr = \"127.0.0.1\" port = 5555 accept = \\ channel -> with daemon socket \\ Server :: accept channel as connection socket \\ Connection :: read_line connection |> socket \\ Connection :: write connection end in with socket \\ Server :: channel addr port as channel infi ( \\-> accept channel ) end module expression \u00b6 module is an expression representing a set of records (optional) and functions. A module must export at least one function, others may be private - usable only from functions defined within the same module. Records are always visible only within the same module and may not be exported. A module may be defined as a file - in this case, the file must take the name of the module + .yona . Also, see section about module loader for details regarding loading modules. module package\\ DemoMmodule exports function1 , function2 as record DataStructure = ( field_one , field_two ) function1 = : something function2 = : something_else end Calling functions from a module is denoted by a double colon: package\\ DemoModule :: function1 Modules must have capitalized names, while packages are expected to start with a lowercase letter. Module may also be defined dynamically, for example assigned to a name in a let expression: let some_module = module TestModule exports test_function as test_function = 5 end in some_module :: test_function In this case the name of the module does not matter, as the module is assigned to the test_module value. with expression : resource management \u00b6 with expression handles resource management within its scope. It initializes the scope with a context manager that is available within the scope its body. The syntax lookes like this ( as alias part is optional): with contextManager as alias bodyExpression end The contextManager expression must return a context manager . If no alias is used, then the context manager is not meant to be interacted with directly. An example for this would be an STM transaction, that just needs to be present but there is no need to directly refer to it. Alternatively, if the alias is specified, as usually case with files, then the file creted in the contextManager part of this expression can be directly accessed in bodyExpression . Example that reads all lines using File::read_lines function: with File :: open \"File.txt\" { : read } as file File :: read_lines file end Packages \u00b6 Packages are logical units for organizing modules. Modules stored in packages must follow a folder structure which is exactly the same as the package path. Records \u00b6 New data structures in Yona can be implemented simply by using tuples. However, as tuples grow in number of elements, it may become useful to name those elements rather than always matching on a particular n-th element. To do so, Yona provides records . Records are essentially named tuples with names for each element and can be used to refer to a particular element by that name. Records exist within the scope of a module and cannot be imported by or exported to other modules. Modules are meant to provide an interface via functions alone. A record is defined by its name and a list of field names. Here's an example of a record definition: record Car = ( brand , model , engine_type ) To initialize a new record instance, following syntax should be used: let car = Car ( brand = \"Audi\" , model = \"A4\" , engine_type = \"TDI\" ) in ... Note that not all fields are required when initializing record. Uninitialized fields are then initialized with value of () (unit). At least one field must be provided during initialization, though (its value may be unit as well). Updating an existing record instance (actually creating a new one with some fields changed) can be done using this syntax: let new_car = car ( model = \"A6\" ) # this is same as Car(brand=\"Audi\", model=\"A4\", engine_type=\"TDI\") in ... To access a field from a record instance a dot syntax is used: IO::println new_car.model # will print A6 Pattern matching on records is very easy as well: order_car Car ( brand = \"Audi\" , model = model ) = order_audi_model model order_car Car ( brand = \"Lexus\" , model = model ) = order_lexus_model model order_car any_car@Car = order_elsewhere any_car # the whole record_instance is available under name any_car import expression : importing functions from other modules \u00b6 Normally, it is not necessary to import modules, as it is often the case in many other languages. Functions from another modules can be called without explicitly declaring them as imported. However, Yona has a special import expression (and as such it returns the value of the expression followed by the in keyword) that allows importing functions from modules and in that way create aliases for otherwise fully qualified names. import funone as one_fun, otherfun from package \\S impleModule funtwo from other \\p ackage \\N otSimpleModule in onefun :something # expression that is the return value of the whole import expression Note that importing functions from multiple modules is possible, they just have to be put on new lines. Functions can be renamed using the as keyword. See the section about module loader for more details regarding loading modules. raise , try / catch expressions : raising and catching exceptions \u00b6 Yona is not a pure language, therefore it allows raising exceptions. Exceptions in Yona are represented as a tuple of a symbol and a message. Message can be empty, if not provided as an argument to the keyword/function raise . Exceptions in Yona consist of three components. First component, is the type of the exception, represented as a symbol. The second component is a string description of the exception - an error message. Last component is the stacktrace which is appended by the runtime automatically. Raising an exception can be accomplished by the raise expression: raise :badarg \"Error message\" # where :badarg is a symbol denoting type of exception Catching an exception is done with try / catch . Catching an exception is essentially pattern matching on an exception triple that consists of all three exception components. try expression catch (:badarg, error_msg, stacktrace) -> :error (:io_error, error_msg, stacktrace) -> :error end Loops : recursion and generators \u00b6 Yona is a functional language with immutable data types and no variables. This means that imperative constructs for loops, such as while or for cannot be used. Instead, iteration is normally achieved via recursion. Yona is able to optimize tail-recursive function calls, so they would not stack overflow. A typical Python solution using mutation might look like this: def factorial ( n ): i = n while i > 1 : i -= 1 n *= i return n However, this solution requires mutable variables, which are not present in Yona. So, an example of a recursive function to calculate factorial in Yona would be: factorial 1 = 1 factorial n = n * factorial ( n - 1 ) Note that this function is actually not tail-recursive. This is because factorial (n - 1) is evaluated before n * (factorial (n - 1)) , so the multiplication is the last expression here and thus there is a potential for stack overflow. That might often not be an issue, just something to consider when writing recursive functions. It would actually not be very difficult to rewrite this function to be tail-recursive, such as: factTR 0 a = a factTR n a = factTR ( n - 1 ) ( n * a ) factorial n = factTR n 1 In this case there is a helper function that is tail-recursive, since the last expression in that function is the call to itself. Generators \u00b6 Another way to iterate over a collection (sequence, set or dictionary) are generator expressions. They allow transforming an existing collection into another one (of possibly different type, such as sequence to dictionary). Generators consist of three or four components: Syntax for a generator generating a sequence from a set: [ x * 2 | x <- { 1 , 2 , 3 }] # the source collection is a set of 1 , 2 , 3 , so the result is [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] [ x * 2 | x <- { 1 , 2 , 3 } if x % 2 == 0 ] # generator with a condition , so the result is [ 4 ] Syntax for a generator generating a set from a sequence: [ x * 2 | x <- [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]] # the source collection is a set of 1 , 2 , 3 , so the result is { 2 , 4 , 6 } [ x * 2 | x <- [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] if x % 2 == 0 ] # generator with a condition , so the result is { 4 } Syntax for a generator generating a dictionary: { key = val * 2 | key = val <- { : a = 1 , : b = 2 , : c = 3 }} # the source collection is a set of 1 , 2 , 3 , so the result is { : a = 2 , : b = 4 , : c = 6 } { key = val * 2 | key = val <- { : a = 1 , : b = 2 , : c = 3 } if val % 2 == 0 } # generator with a condition , so the result is { : b = 4 } Generators are an easy an convenient way to transform built-in collections. They are, however, themselves implemented using the reusable Transducers module. For example, a set generator without using the above mentioned syntax \"sugar\" could look like: Transducers :: filter \\ val -> val < 0 ( \\-> 0 , \\ acc val -> acc + val , \\ acc -> acc * 2 ) |> Set :: reduce [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] The description of the Transducer functions can be found in the module itself. Transducers may be combined in order to create more complex transformations. Also, custom collection may implement their version of a reduce function that accepts a transducer and reduces the collection as desired. Strings \u00b6 Strings in Yona are technically sequences of UTF-8 characters. Character in Yona can be written between apostrophes. Working with strings is then no different than working with any other sequence. String literals can be multi-line as well. There is no special syntax for multi-line strings and a single pair of quotes is used to denote all string literals. String Interpolation \u00b6 Yona supports string interpolation for convenience in formatting strings. The syntax is as follows: \"this string contains an interpolated {variable}\" In this string the {variable} part is replaced with whatever contents of the variable . Technically, variable is a name of a bound variable, or an expression in parentheses. It is also possible to use string interpolation with alignment option, which can be used for formatting tabular outputs: \"{column1,10}|{column2, 10}\" The alignment number will make the value align to the right and filled with spaces to the left, if positive. If the number is negative, the opposite applies and the text is aligned to the left with spaces on the right. The number can be either a literal value or any expression that returns an integer.","title":"Syntax"},{"location":"syntax.html#terminology","text":"These are some common terms and phrases used throughout these texts explained to a user unfamiliar with functional concepts: Function application : simply function call. Currying : a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c) . Currying doesn\u2019t call a function. It just transforms it. The example uses JavaScript syntax for clarity. Alias : what would be a variable in other languages, but cannot have its value modified during program execution. Once set, this alias , or a name , always contains the same original value. Pattern : an expected shape of a value. If the value \"matches\" this pattern, then this value can also be deconstructed onto it. For instance a pattern can be a first element of a list and the rest. The first element can be also assigned to an alias (or the rest), provided that the value matched this pattern. Patterns can be nested and serve as a building blocks for describing data structure for matching and extracting values. Patterns may be as simple as an alias - that is also a pattern in a way. An alias will be matched if an only it is a new name, that was not previously assigned, or if it was, then only if the value is the same as the one previously assigned to it. Guard : guards are additional conditions that may be applied to patterns, that otherwise couldn't be expressed using pattern syntax. Typical example might be a function call to determine a type of a value for example. String interpolation : process of substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string. For instance, if there a template for saying hello to a person like \"Hello {parson}, nice to meet you!\", where the placeholder should be replaced with an actual person's name. This process is called string interpolation.","title":"Terminology"},{"location":"syntax.html#functions-definition-and-application","text":"Functions in Yona are defined in a very short and concise form. They may take arguments, which the function can pattern match on, and one function can be defined using multiple arguments. Function names must start with a lowercase letter, followed by any letters, numbers or underscores. A simple function to calculate a factorial can be written for example this way: factorial 1 = 1 factorial n = n * factorial ( n - 1 ) Each function case must be on a new line. More complex conditions in patterns can be specified in this way: factorial 1 = 1 factorial n | n > 1 = n * factorial ( n - 1 ) Which means that there is an additional condition for the n value to be greater than 0. There may be multiple guards for each pattern and they must each be on a new line. A guard starts with the | character, followed an expression that must evaluate to a boolean and finally an = and the expression to evaluate if the pattern matches and the guard is true . Guards are used to express conditions that must be met in order for the pattern to match. A pattern may have none, one or multiple guards, and the first one matching will cause the pattern to match. Note that function arguments may actually be full patterns, not just argument names. Patterns are described in the section named Pattern Matching . Yona additionally supports non-linear patterns, meaning that if a pattern contains the same name multiple times, than this name is required to match the same value so that the pattern would match. This can be handy when checking for one value to be present in multiple places/arguments without having to explicitly write a guard that would ensure the equality.","title":"Functions: definition and application"},{"location":"syntax.html#anonymous-functions-aka-lambdas","text":"Since functions are first-class citizens in Yona, it is necessary to provide means of passing functions as arguments, and also to define them without giving them a name.

If fewer arguments are provided than the function expects, this is considered a curried call, and the result of such function is a partially applied function, that can be called with the remaining arguments at a later point. So for example calling a factorial would look simply like this: factorial 5 Since Yona is a strictly evaluated language, meaning that arguments are evaluated before calling the function (as opposed to a lazy language, where arguments are only evaluated when actually used by the called function), there is one situation to be careful about and that is passing lambda functions of zero arguments as arguments to functions. This would be evaluated before actually calling the function. If there are no side-effects happening in the lambda, it might be perfectly fine, however if the lambda must be passed as a lambda, it needs to be wrapped into another lambda at the call-site, such as for example: let lambda = \\- > IO::println :hello in do_something_with \\- > lambda # instead of do_something_with lambda Then the do_something_with function will obtain its argument as a function and not a result of IO::println :hello function (that would be :hello btw).","title":"Function application: calling functions"},{"location":"syntax.html#pipes-and-operator-precedence","text":"Since Yona is an ML-style language and, unlike many C-like languages, it does not use parentheses to denote a function application, it can become unclear which expressions are arguments of which function.

If the latter, then it can be written this way: Seq :: take 5 ( Seq :: random 10 ) Since any expression can be put into parentheses and be given precedence in evaluation. Another way to write this would be using pipes : Seq :: take 5 <| Seq :: random 10 or Seq :: random 10 |> Seq :: take 5 These are all equivalent expression and it is up to the programmer's preference to decide which one to use.

Each line consists of an alias or a pattern on the left side, and the expression to evaluate on the right side. The result of this expression is then matched to the pattern on the left side, or simply assigned to an alias, depending on what is on the left side. The result of this let expression is the result of the expression2 expression. If a pattern on the left is not matched on any of the lines, the whole let expression raises a :nomatch exception. One line can use names defined in previous lines. Every alias/pattern must be defined on a new line. Note that the order of execution of the alias/pattern lines is not strictly sequential. Considering the example in the documentation homepage , some aliases can be executed as a single batch, in parallel, provided that two conditions are met: * the do not depend on each other (do not use names provided by other aliases in the same batch) * they return a runtime Promise (IO operations, or results of the async function) When both conditions are met, Yona can safely execute them concurrently, avoiding unnecessary blocking and effectively speeding up the program execution.","title":"let expression: defining local aliases / pattern matching in the scope of evaluated expression"},{"location":"syntax.html#do-expression","text":"The do expression is used to define a sequence of side effecting expressions.

It is also possible to use string interpolation with alignment option, which can be used for formatting tabular outputs: \"{column1,10}|{column2, 10}\" The alignment number will make the value align to the right and filled with spaces to the left, if positive. If the number is negative, the opposite applies and the text is aligned to the left with spaces on the right. The number can be either a literal value or any expression that returns an integer.","title":"String Interpolation"},{"location":"features/data-types.html","text":"Yona is dynamically typed language, meaning that types are checked during runtime.

It allows simple, short way of specifying patterns for the built in types, specifically: Pattern matching, in combination with recursion are the basis of the control flow in Yona. Scalar values - integer, float, byte, character, boolean, symbol \u00b6 Pattern matching for scalar values is super simple. The pattern looks is the value itself, for example: case expr of 5 -> do_something 6 -> do_something_else end Tuples \u00b6 Pattern matching on tuples: case expr of ( : ok , value ) -> do_something value # value contains the second element of the tuple ( : error , message ) -> IO :: println message end Records \u00b6 Pattern matching on records is described in the section about Records. Underscore pattern \u00b6 The underscore pattern _ will match any value. Sequence & reverse sequence, multiple head & tails & their combinations in patterns \u00b6 Sequence is a biderctional structure and can be easily pattern matched from either left or right side. Yona allows pattern matching on more than a single element as well: Matching sequence on the beginning \u00b6 case [ 1 ] of 1 -| [] -> 2 [] -> 3 _ -> 9 end This code will result in 2 . Yona allows matching on more than just one element in the beginning: case [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] of 1 -| 2 -| [] -> 2 1 -| 2 -| tail -> tail [] -> 3 _ -> 9 end Will produce [3, 4] . Matching sequence on the end \u00b6 case [ 1 ] of [] |- 1 -> 2 [] -> 3 _ -> 9 end This code will result in 2 . Obtaining a remainer of a sequnce \u00b6 case [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] of 1 -| [] -> 2 1 -| tail -> tail [] -> 3 _ -> 9 end This code will result in [2, 3] . This could also be done from the other end of the sequence, using |- operator instead (and reversing head/tails sections). Matching a sequence elements \u00b6 case arg of [] -> 3 [ 1 , second , 3 ] -> second _ -> 9 end Will produce 2 . Matching strings \u00b6 Since strings are sequences of characters, they can be pattern matched on as such. Alternatively string literals may be used as well, or any combination of the two. For example: case \"hello there\" of 'h' -| 'e' -| _ |- 'r' |- 'e' -> 0 _ -> 1 end Which will produce a 0 . Another example: case [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ] of h -| \"bc\" -> h _ -> 1 end Which produces an 'a' . Dictionary patterns \u00b6 Dictionaries can be matched on both keys and values. Example: case { \"a\" = 1 , \"b\" = 2 } of { \"b\" = 3 } -> 3 { \"a\" = 1 , \"b\" = bb } -> bb _ -> 9 end This will result in 2 . \"As\" patterns \u00b6 Sometimes it can be useful to name a collection (sequence, set or dictionary) or a record in a pattern for later use. For example when matching on a record type, but ignoring all the fields. This can be done using @ syntax in Yona: let mod = module TestMod exports testfun as record TestRecord = ( argone , argtwo ) testfun = case TestRecord ( argone = 1 , argtwo = 2 ) of 2 -> 0 x @ TestRecord -> x . argone _ -> 2 end end in mod :: testfun This slightly with an inlined module definition more complex example will produce 1 . Remember that records exist on a module level only. let expression patterns \u00b6 let expression allows using patterns on the left side of its assignments. In that way it is not necessary to use case expression explicitly. * do expression patterns \u00b6 do expression similarly to let expressions allows defining aliases, and they can be patterns on the left side. Unlike let expression, do expression does not require value assignment, but still allows it. For example: do ( one , _ ) = ( 1 , :unused ) IO :: println one two = 2 one + two end Which will result in 3 after 1 is printed. case patterns \u00b6 This is THE pattern matching expression. It maches a value against a list of patterns and executes the expression of the matching pattern. Function & lambda patterns \u00b6 Functions and lambdas may be defined using patterns as explained in the section about functions. The only limitation of the lambda definitions, is that they may only contain one pattern. This is not used much for control flow, but still useful for deconstructing some data structures. If lambda needs to pattern match multiple patterns, either define it as a named function, or use case expression. Guard expressions \u00b6 Patterns may be enhanced further with guard expressions. Guard expressions are initiated by a | character followed by an expression that must evaluate into a boolean. Each pattern may have multiple guard expressions, each on a new line. For example, a function calculating body mass index could be defined like this: bmiTell bmi | bmi <= 18.5 = \"You're underweight, you emo, you!\" | bmi <= 25.0 = \"You're supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you're ugly!\" | bmi <= 30.0 = \"You're fat! Lose some weight, fatty!\" | true = \"You're a whale, congratulations!\" As can be seen, guards allow checking additional conditions that can't be captured by pattern itself, such as checking whether a number is in a range. Non-linear patterns - ability to use same variable in pattern multiple times \u00b6 Non-linear patterns are those that contain the same name in multiple places, for example: nonLinearHeadTailsTest head -| _ head -| _ = head nonLinearHeadTailsTest headOne -| _ headTwo -| _ = headOne + headTwo For example, calling this function: nonLinearHeadTailsTest [ 2 , 0 ] [ 3 , 0 ] Will yield 5 , because the first element in first and second argument must be the same.","title":"Pattern Matching"},{"location":"features/pattern-matching.html#scalar-values-integer-float-byte-character-boolean-symbol","text":"Pattern matching for scalar values is super simple.

Dictionaries are immutable data structure containing unique pairs of key and value. Usage \u00b6 There is a special syntax to create an empty dictionary: {} . Dictionaries support special operators for adding elements or operations typical for dictionaries, such as unions or intersections etc. Folding a dictionary \u00b6 Folding a dictionary is a process of iterating over its key-value pairs while producing one result value. An example of a folding function could be a sum function, that iterates over all elements and adds all the values up, producing a single result. Functions foldl take 3 arguments: * 2-argument lambda (accumulator, (key, value)) returning a new value of an accumulator * initial value of the accumulator * dictionary to fold This example shows how to sum up a dictionary: Dict :: fold ( \\ acc ( key , value ) -> acc + value ) 0 { 'a' = 1 , 'b' = 2 , 'c' = 3 } Reducing a dictionary \u00b6 Reducing a dictionary means applying a transducer onto a dictionary. Transducers are a generic, high-level method for implementing operations over a data structure. Function reduce takes 2 arguments: * transducer * dictionary to reduce Example with a map transducer: Dict :: reduce ( Transducers :: map \\ val -> val * 2 ( 0 , \\ state val -> state + 1 , identity )) { 'a' = 1 , 'b' = 2 , 'c' = 3 } This example will produce 12 , as it sums up all the values doubled.

First argument is the second is the key and the second one is the dictionary. length = Dict :: lookup 'a' { 'a' = 1 , 'b' = 2 , 'c' = 3 } Building a dictionary from a sequence of tuples \u00b6 Function from_seq builds a dictionary from a sequence of tuples. Example: Dict :: from_seq [( 1 , 4 ), ( 2 , 5 ), ( 3 , 6 )] Will return {1 = 4, 2 = 5, 3 = 6} . Turning a dictionary to a sequence of tuples \u00b6 Function entries is the inverse operation of the from_seq function and it returns a sequence of tuples (key, value) for the provided dictionary. Example: Dict :: entries { 1 = 4 , 2 = 5 , 3 = 6 } Will return [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)] . Getting keys from the dictionary \u00b6 Function keys returns a set of all keys for the provided dictionary.

Usage \u00b6 All file access is non-blocking and asynchronous. Behind the courtains, file operations use AsynchronousFileChannel . Files can be worked in either text or binary mode. Text mode anticipates that file is encoded in UTF-8 encoding, whereas binary file may contain any contents. Opening a file \u00b6 File must be opened before used. Function open takes a path and set of file \"modes\" as arguments and returns a file handle. This handle is actually a tuple with several items, that should not be accessed directly, but instead handled to functions operating on a file, from this module. Opening file for reading, in a text mode, for example: fh = File :: open \"test.txt\" { : read } Available modes (for further details, refer to Java's StandardOpenOption ): Mode Description :read Open for read access. :write Open for write access. :append If the file is opened for :write access then bytes will be written to the end of the file rather than the beginning. :truncate_existing If the file already exists and it is opened for :write access, then its length is truncated to 0. :create Create a new file if it does not exist. :create_new Create a new file, failing if the file already exists. :delete_on_close Delete on close. :sparse Sparse file. :sync Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. :dsync Requires that every update to the file's content be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. Opening and closing files with context managers \u00b6 Context managers are the recommended way of dealing with files. They provide error handling, such that the user does not need to worry about properly closing files in all situations. Using files as context managers is really simple, since it requires nothing more than the open function, that already returns a context manager! Therefore using files in this way is as simple as writing: with File :: open \"File.txt\" { : read } as file File :: read_lines file end There is no need to explicitly close files when using context managers. Deleting a file \u00b6 Function to delete an existing file takes a file handle a returns a () . File :: delete fh Seeking to a position in a file \u00b6 Seeking to a position takes a file handle, new position (integer) and returns an updated file handle: new_fh = File :: seek fh position Creating a temporary file \u00b6 In order to create a temporary file in a system temp folder, pass a prefix (string), suffix (string) and a set of file modes. Function returns a new handle, with a newly created temporary file, opened using the specified file modes. The file will be kept after use, unless :delete_on_close option was specified. fh = File :: make_temp \"prefix\" \"suffix\" { : write } Obtaining a path from a file handle \u00b6 It can be useful to obtain a path from a file handle, for example when working with temporary files. Path is a string. path = File :: path fh Listing files in a directory \u00b6 To list files in a directory, use function list_dir . Note that this function does not recurse over nested subfolders. files = File :: list_dir \"./\" Reading file - line mode \u00b6 File can be read either as a whole, or in lines (provided that it is a text file). Lines may be separated by either \\n or \\r\\n . Function read_line expects a file handle, and returns either :eof if the whole file was already read, or a triple of: * :ok * body - either a byte sequence or a string, depending on a mode file is opened in * new file handle Counting lines in a file can be implemented for example this way: count_file_lines file = read_lines fh 0 read_lines fh acc = case File :: read_line fh of ( : ok , _ , new_fh ) -> read_lines new_fh ( acc + 1 ) : eof -> acc end Function read_all_lines will count the number of lines in a file.

Usage \u00b6 This module has very simple interface. Just two functions, one to parse a string or a byte sequence, another one taking any Yona value and turning it into a JSON represented as a string. Parsing JSON \u00b6 Function parse takes either a string (character sequence), or a byte sequence (can be obtained by reading a file in a binary mode for example), and produces a Yona value. Example: let { \"1\" = one } = JSON :: parse \"{{ \\\" 1 \\\" : 2, \\\" 3 \\\" : 4}}\" in one This program parses the JSON string and returns a Yona dictionary, which is then pattern matched on and a key of \"1\" is assigned to name one . Thus the result of this expression is 2 . Note that JSON has fewer data types, for example it has no representation of symbols. Regarding numbers, Yona first tries to parse them as integers, if that's not possible, it will parse them as floats.

Folding a sequence \u00b6 Folding a sequence is a process of iterating over its values while producing one result value. An example of a folding function could be a sum function, that iterates over all elements and adds them up, producing a single result. Sequences can be folded from both directions - left or right. Module Seq contains functions foldl and foldr for folding from the left or right side respectively. Functions foldl and foldr take 3 arguments: * 2-argument lambda (accumulator, element) returning a new value of an accumulator * initial value of the accumulator * sequence to fold This example shows how to sum up a sequence: Seq :: foldl ( \\ acc val -> acc + val ) 0 [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] Reducing a sequence \u00b6 Reducing a sequence means applying a transducer onto a sequence.

Any error raised by functions in this module raise an exception of type :stm . Any expression inside the body of a context manager will have implicit access to the transaction from its scope. Instantiating a new STM \u00b6 In order to use an STM for read/write operations, one must first create the STM itself. Reference to the STM instance will be used by all other functions. STM itself is of a special type stm . Example: stm = STM :: new Creating a var - key for some value in the STM \u00b6 STM uses concepts of vars, which are references to the STM, and they are actually their own special type in Yona. Creating a new var: var = STM :: var stm initial_value Creating a new var requires the STM instance and an initial value this var holds. Starting a read-only transaction \u00b6 Function read_tx creates a read-only transaction wrapped in a context manager . It takes a reference to the STM system and returns the context manager. Access the STM in a transaction: with STM :: read_tx stm STM :: run ( \\-> check_balance ) end Starting a read-write transaction \u00b6 Function write_tx creates a read-write transaction wrapped in a context manager .

Reading a value of a var \u00b6 A var may be read either inside or outside of a transaction. Reading a var outside of a transaction, aka a dirty read, may provide a value that has been modified by another running transaction and not yet committed. Funciton read expects one argument, the var and returns a value this var contains. Example: value = STM :: read var Writing to a var \u00b6 Function var must be called within a transaction. It expects var and the new value to be written. This function returns a () . Example: STM :: write var new_value Protecting a var from a concurrent write in another transaction \u00b6 Function protect ensures that a var cannot be overriden from another transaction.
